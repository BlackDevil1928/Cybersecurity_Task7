## ❗ Risks of Malicious Extensions

- **Data Theft**: Extensions with `read and change data on all websites` can steal passwords, cookies, and form data.
- **Keylogging**: Some track keystrokes and clipboard data.
- **Redirection**: Malicious plugins can redirect traffic to phishing sites.
- **Background Surveillance**: Some run scripts silently, consuming resources or injecting ads.

## 🔐 Best Practices

- Only install from trusted sources (e.g., Chrome Web Store)
- Always check **permissions** requested
- Regularly audit and remove unused extensions
- Avoid extensions asking for “read your data on all websites”
- Keep extensions updated
